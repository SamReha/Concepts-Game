# Concepts-Game
The Concepts Game web app is a mobile and tablet-friendly web-based application intended to enable the testing and teaching of basic recognition abilities, focusing on the userâ€™s ability to perceive and express simple relations between objects (e.g., which object is bigger or smaller, longer or shorter, fuller or emptier, etc.). The app will feature a very simple touch-based UI on compatible devices, with assistive voice tags. Laptop or desktop computers will feature the same UI, albeit with touches replaced with mouse-clicks.

Our target users are adults with developmental disabilities, particularly those in need of a way to learn and practice basic recognition abilities. As we will be working with Imagine on this project, users will also be Imagine educators who will use the web-app to test and assess the ability levels of the Imagine participants. Thusly, we will recruit our target users through Imagine directly.

In order to access the web app, users will need laptops, tablets or other mobile devices with active internet connections. We propose to develop the web app using web2py, a web development framework that enables rapid prototyping. We will also require a basic web hosting service to host the web app and make it accessible to users, as well as several tablets and mobile devices for testing (of which we already have a few available to us).
